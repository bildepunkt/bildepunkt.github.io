The ISS is incredible. But I don't care that much about it. The exploration of nebulae, galaxies, star cluseters and celestial bodies is what gets me super jazzed. <!-- more -->Missions like [New Horizons](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html), [Rosetta](https://www.nasa.gov/rosetta), [Curiosity](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html), etc. give me butterflies. And so it goes with the [Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html) mission. I love the mystery of space, and the potential for life changing findings in our own solar system. I can't wait to see what Juno teaches us.

It may be shocking, but I am not, in fact, a scientist, nor am I involved with any space programs. So I figured the next best thing would be to write some code to express mah feels... I give thee *"Juno on Canvas"*!
