Hello, allow me to introduce myself: my name is Chris and I live in the incredibly beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada. I am a father, a husband, a front-end focused software developer, a coffee and beer enthusiast, a fairly diciplined vegetarian, a part-time metalhead, a musician, a migraine sufferer, a lefty (in hand and politics alike), a sporadic martial arts practitioner and to top it all off I have a childlike fascination with the natural world and the space that surrounds it.

Most articles will be on Javascript and cool new web-dev technologies, but my other interests might creep in too. Stay tuned... unless, of course, you've thoroughly hated the previous paragraph. :)
