Hello, I'm Chris. Allow me to introduce myself: I live in the incredibly beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada and I am a father, a husband, a front-end focused software developer, a coffee and beer enthusiast, a fairly diciplined vegetarian, a metalhead, a musician, a migraine sufferer, a lefty (in hand as well as politics) and a sporadic martial arts practitioner. Most articles will be on Javascript and cool new web-dev technologies, but my other interests might creep in too. Stay tuned... unless, of course, you've thoroughly hated the previous paragraph. :)
