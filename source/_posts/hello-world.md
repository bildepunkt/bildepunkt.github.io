Hey, I'm Chris. I'm a software developer hailing from beautiful Vancouver BC. I am also a dad, a husband, a coffee and beer enthusiast, a fairly diciplined vegetarian, a part-time metalhead, a musician, a lefty (in hand and politics alike), an admirer of great design - graphical and otherwise, and a sporadic martial arts practitioner. I am fascinated by space and the natural world, and count myself lucky to have been given the opportunity to experience a small part of it.
