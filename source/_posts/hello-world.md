Hey, I'm Chris. I'm a software developer from Vancouver BC.<!-- more --> I am also a dad, a husband, a coffee and beer enthusiast, a shoddy vegetarian, a part-time metalhead, a musician, a lefty (in hand and politics alike), a design enthusiast - graphical and otherwise, and a sporadic martial arts practitioner.  I am fascinated by space and the natural world, and count myself lucky to have been given the opportunity to experience a small part of it.

Most articles in this blog will be on cool, shiny new things in the world of web development, but my other interests might creep in too. Stay tuned... unless, of course, you've thoroughly hated the previous paragraph. :)
