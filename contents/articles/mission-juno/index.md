The ISS is incredible but I don't give it a lot of thought. Missions like [New Horizons](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html), [Rosetta](https://www.nasa.gov/rosetta), [Curiosity](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html), however, get me jazzed like a Billy Cobham drum solo. And the [Juno](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/main/index.html) mission is no exception.
    
##    

Juno will orbit Jupiter's poles in an effort to understand the planet's composition, study its intense magnetosphere, and observe its incredible auroras. It's taken four years for Juno to make its lonely journey. Along with some preliminary images, Juno has already sent back audio of the "roar" of Jupiter's magnetic and gravitational fields. It's mission results like this that have made me fall in love the mystery of space, and the possibility of life-changing findings in our own solar system. My 8 year-old often points to the sky and reminds me of the three lego figures Jupiter, Juno, and Galileo floating 588,000,000 kilometers away in Juno's radioactively-shielded core.

Seeing as I will likey never contribute to a space mission directly, I figured the next best thing would be to write some code to express mah feels: I give thee *Juno on Canvas*! The entire image is rendered procedurally via the canvas' various drawing apis. I'm hoping to add some interaction, stats, and Jupiter itself into this piece sometime in the future.
