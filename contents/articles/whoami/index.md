Hello, my name is Chris. I am a software developer from Vancouver BC. My first professional software project was for the now defunkt Future Shop, developing a virtual remote car-starter installation module in Flash. After a few more contracts I was hired full time at Best Buy Canada and worked my way up to the ecommerce team as a Javascript developer. After many years and a few more companies I am now a software development engineer at Ping Identity where I write enterprise web apps.   
&nbsp;  
Believe it or not, I do have a life outside of programming. Although I spend way to much of my spare time writing code. I am also a dad and husband, a Brazillian Jiu Jitsu practitioner, a rather shoddy vegetarian, a drummer and a graphic design enthusiast.    
&nbsp;  
Most articles in this blog will be on programming and other technical geekery, but my other interests might creep in too.
