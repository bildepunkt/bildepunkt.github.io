Hello, my name is Chris. I am a software developer from Vancouver BC. I am passionate about software architecture, standards based platforms, and the utilization of modern tools and frameworks to develop maintainable, extensible, and reusable code that works beautifully on any platform.    

##    

I first got into programming via (then, Macromedia) Flash. I was enamored with the combination of vector drawing, animation, and software authoring. It felt like I could build anything. After working as a technical animator in tv, games, and film for a number of years I was offered a contract to develop a Flash-based training module for Best Buy Canada. I was soon hired full time and worked my way up to the ecommerce team as a Javascript developer. After many years and a few more companies I am now a software development engineer at Ping Identity where I write front-end-focused, enterprise identity management applications.    
&nbsp;  
Believe it or not, I do have a life outside of programming. Although I spend way to much of my spare time writing code. I am also a dad and husband, a Brazillian Jiu Jitsu practitioner, a rather shoddy vegetarian, a drummer and a graphic design enthusiast.

Most articles in this blog will be on programming and other technical geekery, but my other interests might creep in too.
