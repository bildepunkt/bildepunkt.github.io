Hey, I'm Chris. I'm a software developer from Vancouver BC. I am also a dad and husband, a coffee and beer enjoyer, a shoddy vegetarian, a part-time metalhead, a drummer who thinks he can play bass, a lefty (in hand and politics alike), and a design enthusiast - graphical and otherwise. I occasionally like to roll on the floor or exchange knees, hooks and elbows with nice people in friendly training environments.  I am fascinated by space and the natural world, and count myself lucky to have been given the opportunity to experience a small part of it.    
&nbsp;    
Most articles in this blog will be on cool, shiny new things in the world of web development, but my other interests might creep in too. I also may express my &quot;humour&quot; through irreverence or sarcasm; for this I am sorry. Stay tuned... unless, of course, you've thoroughly hated the previous paragraph. :)
